## Title of the Project
Facial Attendance Recorder System using Tensorflow 

## About
<!--Detailed Description about the project-->

-Face detection also called facial detection is an artificial intelligence (AI) based computer technology used to find and identify human faces in digital images. Everything else including buildings, automobiles, and trees is disregarded in favour of detecting face traits. When faced with a complicated visual landscape, humans are particularly adept at navigating faces. They are able to identify a face and match it to a recognized individual in order to retrieve information about that person, including name and other details. In a fraction of a second, everything occurs easily. Because of this, the most active topic of computer science research in vision is face identification. It is more frequently used for video surveillance. To identify a human face in a bigger image and disregard other objects, face detection programs employ algorithms and machine learning. 

## Features
<!--List the features of the project as shown below-->

-	Facial Recognition: Facial attendance recorder systems utilize advanced facial recognition algorithms to accurately identify individuals based on unique facial features.
-	
- Attendance Tracking: The system records attendance by matching detected faces with pre-registered profiles in the system's database.
- 
-	Database Management: Facial data of individuals, along with their attendance records, are securely stored in a centralized database for efficient management and monitoring.
-	
-	Real-time Updates: Attendance information is updated in real-time, providing administrators with instant access to attendance data.
-	
-	Reporting: Some systems offer reporting functionalities, allowing administrators to generate attendance reports for analysis and decision-making purposes.
-	
-	User Interface: User-friendly interfaces are provided for both administrators and users, facilitating easy interaction with the system to view attendance status and manage settings.


## Requirements
<!--List the requirements of the project as shown below-->
* Hardware Requirements:
Computer with sufficient processing power (CPU/GPU) to run TensorFlow efficiently.
Webcam or camera for capturing facial images.
*Software Requirements:

*TensorFlow framework: TensorFlow provides the necessary tools for building and training deep learning models, including those for facial recognition.

## Results and Impact
<!--Give the results and impact as shown below-->
In conclusion, facial attendance recording systems offer a promising solution for automating attendance tracking in various environments, including educational institutions, workplaces, and public venues.

These systems leverage facial recognition technology to accurately and efficiently identify individuals, record their attendance, and generate comprehensive attendance reports. 

Moreover, the potential for bias and discrimination in facial recognition algorithms underscores the importance of fairness and equity in system design and implementation. 

Efforts to mitigate biases, ensure algorithmic transparency, and promote diversity and inclusion are critical to building trust and confidence in facial attendance recording systems.
